   <h3>Only Thing We Know</h3>
   <p>I'm feeling faded I'm running around and I'm stuck in the phase yeah Been like this lately, oh-oh I need a doctor to give me a shot so I no longer suffer And I need a lawyer, oh-oh
   </p>
   <p>'Cause I've not been too good this time, People say I lost my mind, And I shouldn't be hanging with you, No I don't care bout what they say, That don't mean nothing to me ,Nobody can do what you do
   </p>
   <p>You take me even higher than I have ever been, I'm moving to your rhythm, oh, I feel it in my skin, We've never getting sober, we're always letting go, Still moving to your rhythm, it's the only thing we know, It's the only thing we know</p>
